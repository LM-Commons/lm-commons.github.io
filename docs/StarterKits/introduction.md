The intent of the LM-Commons Starter Kits is to provide skeletons, either based on Laminas MVC or on Laminas Mezzio,
that meet business needs above the basic MVC and Mezzio frameworks by including user management, role based access, CORS
and administration modules.

This is a work in progress looking for contributors.
