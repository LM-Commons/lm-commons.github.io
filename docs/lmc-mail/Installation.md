Install the module via Composer:

````shell
$ composer require lm-commons/lmc-mail
````

Composer will inject the module into the modules configuration, or you can add it manually to the `modules.config.php` or
`application.config.php`.

Customize the module by copying and renaming the sample configuration file `lm-commons/lmc-mail/config/lmcmail.local.php.dist` to the application's
`config/autoload`.
