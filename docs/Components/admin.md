## LmcAdmin

[LmcAdmin](https://lm-commons.github.io/LmcAdmin) is a low-level module that helps Laminas MVC Framework developers to 
create an admin interface. 

The module allows to have a uniform layout, navigation structure and routing scheme. You can create controllers routed
as a child of LmcAdmin, so you can easily change the (root) url, access control and other properties. 

The navigation is also flexible, to allow you having a structure built of pages in the admin interface with menus, 
breadcrumbs and other links.
