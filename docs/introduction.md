# Introduction

LM-Commons is a GitHub organization dedicated to the collaborative
and community-driven long-term maintenance of packages & libraries based on the Laminas MVC and Components.

Many of the packages found in the LM-Commons repositories are former ZF-Commons packages
that were migrated to the Laminas Project framework.
